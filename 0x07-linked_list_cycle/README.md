Return: 0 if there is no cycle, 1 if there is a cycle


## Technical interview preparation:

* You are not allowed to google anything
* Whiteboard first
* This task and all future technical interview prep tasks will include checks for the efficiency of your solution, i.e. is your solutionâ€™s runtime fast enough, does your solution require extra memory usage / mallocs, etc.

## Requirements:

* Only these functions are allowed: write, printf, putchar, puts, malloc, free
* Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All your files should end with a new line
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
* All your header files should be include guarded
